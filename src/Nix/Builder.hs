-- | Derivation builder - executes build recipes.
--
-- == The build process
--
-- When Nix needs to build a derivation (cache miss), it:
--
-- 1. Creates a temp directory for the build
-- 2. Sets up the environment: only store paths from @inputDrvs@ and
--    @inputSrcs@ are visible.  PATH contains only the builder and
--    specified dependencies.  No internet access (in sandboxed mode).
-- 3. Runs the builder (usually @bash -e \/nix\/store\/...-stdenv\/setup@)
-- 4. The @setup@ script sources the derivation's environment variables,
--    then runs @genericBuild@ which calls @unpackPhase@, @patchPhase@,
--    @configurePhase@, @buildPhase@, @installPhase@, @fixupPhase@, etc.
-- 5. Builder writes output to @$out@ (the output store path)
-- 6. Nix scans the output for references to other store paths
-- 7. Output is moved to the store and registered
--
-- == On Windows
--
-- The key difference is process creation.  Linux uses @fork\/exec@ with
-- namespace isolation.  We use 'System.Process.createProcess' which maps
-- to @CreateProcess@ on Windows - native, no POSIX layer.
--
-- The builder's process tree runs inside a Win32 job object with
-- kill-on-job-close ('Proc.use_process_jobs'), so an interrupt or a
-- builder exit reaps grandchildren instead of orphaning them.  Filesystem
-- and privilege isolation are still future work: a restricted token with a
-- store-granting ACL (the security boundary), then AppContainer for more.
--
-- We ship @bash.exe@ (from MSYS2) as the default builder on Windows.
-- Same approach as Git for Windows.

-- | The four temp-directory names, every one pointed at the build
-- directory, matching upstream's single assignment of all four.  Tools
-- disagree about which one they read (POSIX tools take @TMPDIR@, msys
-- reads @TMPDIR@ and @TMP@, native Windows tools take @TMP@ then
-- @TEMP@), and a scrubbed environment that repoints only one leaves
-- the others to fall back to a directory the build cannot own - on

-- | Environment variable for the Nix store path.
envNixStore :: Text

-- | Ambient variables a Windows builder may inherit, by uppercase-folded
-- name.  SystemRoot is a hard execution requirement - the CLR's crypto
-- provider fails to load without it (verified live on a clean Windows 11
-- box), while plain Win32 binaries merely tolerate its absence - and
-- SystemDrive and windir are the aliases some tools consult instead of it.
windowsAmbientAllowlist :: [Text]
windowsAmbientAllowlist = [systemRootKey, "SYSTEMDRIVE", "WINDIR"]

-- | The folded name 'scrubAmbient' derives COMSPEC from.
systemRootKey :: Text
systemRootKey = "SYSTEMROOT"

-- | The command interpreter variable, synthesized from SystemRoot rather
-- than inherited: programs shelling out through the C runtime's
-- @system()@ read it from the block.
envComspec :: Text
envComspec = "COMSPEC"

-- | Executable-extension resolution, pinned instead of inherited so name
-- resolution does not drift with host configuration.  cmd.exe's own
-- built-in default when the variable is absent adds @.VBS;.JS;.WS;.MSC@;
-- a build has no business resolving those implicitly.
envPathext, pathextValue :: Text

-- | Environment variable for PATH.
envPath :: Text
envPath = "PATH"

-- | The magic builder string for the built-in URL fetcher.  A derivation with

-- first, then this application, following upstream Nix's
-- @curl/VERSION Nix/VERSION@ shape.  The versions come from Cabal's generated
