-- | __builtin:unpack__ - in-process archive extraction for the bootstrap seed.
--
-- == Why this is a builtin
--
-- The Windows stdenv bootstrap fetches pre-built toolchain tarballs (MSYS2
-- @.pkg.tar.zst@ packages) into the store before any toolchain exists there.
-- Nothing in the store can unpack them - the unpacker is the thing being
-- bootstrapped - and ambient @tar.exe@ is unpinned and may lack zstd support.
-- So, like 'Nix.Builder.runBuiltinFetchurl', extraction runs in-process:
-- a derivation whose @builder@ is @builtin:unpack@ is handled by this module
-- instead of being spawned as a subprocess.
--
-- == Derivation interface
--
-- * @srcs@ - whitespace-separated archive store paths, extracted in order
--   into the single @out@ output.  MSYS2 packages share a top-level
--   @mingw64\/@ prefix, so extracting a package set into one output yields a
--   working toolchain root directly (no separate union step).
-- * @out@ - the merged tree.
--
-- == Determinism
--
-- Extraction is a pure function of the archive bytes: entries are written in
-- archive order, a file appearing in two archives is an error (pacman
-- enforces the same no-conflict invariant), and pacman's per-package
-- metadata entries (@.PKGINFO@, @.MTREE@, ...) are skipped - they are not part
-- of the installed tree and would otherwise collide across packages.
--
-- Symlink and hardlink entries are materialized by __copying__ their target:
-- symlinks on Windows require elevation or Developer Mode, so a link in the
-- store would make the output machine-dependent.  Copying is deterministic
-- everywhere at a small size cost.
