-- | The Nix store: content-addressed, immutable package storage.
--
-- == What the store actually does
--
-- When Nix builds a package, the output goes into the store:
--
-- 1. Builder runs in a temp directory, produces output files
-- 2. Output is scanned for references to other store paths
-- 3. Output is moved to @\/nix\/store\/\<hash\>-\<name\>@
-- 4. Path is registered in the SQLite DB with its references
-- 5. Directory permissions set to read-only (immutability)
--
-- When Nix SUBSTITUTES (downloads from a binary cache):
--
-- 1. Fetch @\<hash\>.narinfo@ from cache - contains NAR hash, size, refs
-- 2. Fetch the @.nar.xz@ file
-- 3. Verify file hash matches narinfo
-- 4. Decompress and unpack NAR into store path
-- 5. Verify NAR hash matches narinfo
-- 6. Register path in DB with references from narinfo
--
-- Both paths end the same way: a registered, immutable store path.
--
-- == Garbage collection
--
-- A GC root is an explicit "keep this" marker (e.g. the current system
-- profile, per-user profiles, result symlinks from @nix-build@).
-- GC walks all roots, follows references transitively, and deletes
-- everything not reachable.  Since paths are immutable and reference
-- tracking is exact, GC is safe - it never deletes something in use.
